- Step 0
	- Action -> send command to scheduler -> OK
		-> Authentication-Session (use start method) -> use cookie session
		-> Reattach old session or purge after login
		-> Define role, ACL
		-> Defines thrusted elements (setup with unique id and check for id exchange)
		-> generates session with more chars
		-> DOS attack prevention
	- Scheduler  -> run every 30 second
		- run operation (with argouments: Session, Source, Command)
		- introduce cache results (time)
		- introduce is changed something 
		- introduce event reaction
	- Operation -> send command to Source and store Results 
		- GW VMware with pywimomy
		- GW Scheduler
		- GW Proxy 
	- Event -> Polling event from Sources (thrusted)
		- User
		- Session
		- DOS attack prevention
		 
- Step 1 -> Architecture
	- WS -> Client
			-> auth -> to Infrastructure
			-> connect
			-> get_system_info
				-> hosts
				-> VMs
				-> datastore
				-> vSwitch
		 -> Remote system
		 	-> command
				-> exec
					-> get_system_info
						-> hosts
						-> VMs
						-> datastore
						-> vSwitch
		 	-> return data
